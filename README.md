NGIMU-MATLAB-Import-Logged-Data-Example
=======================================

This example demonstrates how to import data logged as CSV files using the NGIMU GUI.  The example data was logged from 3 synchronised devices mounted in alignment on a ridged body.  The example script imports the data, resamples the data so that all devices share a common timestamp vector, and then plots the gyroscope measurements of each device.
